# Payroll-Paystub
Hi all. Here's a mostly working version of the payroll/paystub portion of the program. I created a txt file with dummy
employee info so the program has something to pull information from. The code will need to be updated once we decide exactly
how employee information will be written into the file. I have a problem with getting the Employee ID to display for Jane Doe
so if anyone wants to tackle that, feel free! Otherwise, I'll try to talk to one of the SIs next week.
